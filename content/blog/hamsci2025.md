K2MFF helped host [HamSCI](https://hamsci.org/) this last weekend at NJIT and the event was very successful.
This 8th annual workshop brought together the amateur radio community and professional scientists.

Bob Inderbitzen NQ1R of [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/) gave an excellent keynote on why amateur radio is so important and what we need to do to continue to inspire others.
The program also included tutorials from Steve Cerwin WA5FRF, Retired Insitute Scientist from Southwest Research Institute, Derek Kozel K0ZEL/MW0LNA of the [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) Leadership Team, and our own Dr. Louis Lanzerotti, Distinguished Research Professor from the Center for Solar Terestrial Research at NJIT.

NJIT President Dr. Teik C. Lim gave a welcome, pictured below, and Lt. Col. James Carter, Detachment Commander AFROTC and Professor of Aerospace Studies, gave opening remarks.
The welcoming address and closing remarks were given by Dr. Nathaniel Frissell W2NAF and Dr. Gareth Perry KD2SAK respectively.

One of the neatest things about attending a HamSCI conference is that you get to meet and talk with people who are experts in their corner of the amateur radio universe.
K2MFF leadership was able to attend a [Collegiate Amateur Radio Program (CARP)](https://www.arrl.org/collegiate-amateur-radio) meeting in-person with Bob Inderbitzen NQ1R.
Derek Kozel K0ZEL/MW0LNA was even nice enough to sit down with us and answer some of our very basic GNU Radio questions.
I personally had the opportunity to meet and talk with [Phil Karn KA9Q](https://github.com/ka9q/ka9q-radio), [Steve Strohl N8GNJ](https://www.zeroretries.org/), and [Gwyn Griffiths G3ZIL](https://hamsci.org/publications?s=author&f%5Bag%5D=G&f%5Bauthor%5D=307) all of whom I've been want to meet.

So to all participants and everyone who helped make this successfull, thank you and see you in 2026!
