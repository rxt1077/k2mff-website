K2MFF was invited to participate in this year's YWCC presentation for Experience Day at NJIT.
Experience Day gives prospective NJIT students a chance to ask questions and see what student life is like at NJIT.
Ethan Clark AE2EC helped set up and answer questions at the K2MFF table shown below:

We had two SDRs running (AE2EC's is waaaay nicer than mine), a packet/NinoTNC demonstration board, two [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) nodes (one without its case), a GD77 HT, and our [K2MFF Radio/History Oriented Campus Tour](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/126lFxr2gkyl9y9GZjUdF1wy_SEBXGnbKYLGUkxAZzo0/edit?usp=sharing)

Ethan also presented [a slide deck that Grace Revoredo KE2CBY created](/expday2025/presentation.pdf) during the _Minute Madness_ presentations:

After it was all over AE2EC and I went to the top of the NJIT Summit Parking deck where he showed off his sweet mobile HF setup.
Spinning the dial and hearing a lot of contest traffic, Ethan checked contest calendar and realized it was the [CQ WW WPX Contest](https://www.contestcalendar.com/weeklycont.php#17966).
AE2EC pulled the classic amateur radio move of "hand the other person the mic and make them talk".
He taught me how to make a contest contact with a serial number and I must admit it's a little intimidating when the other operator tells you that you're some number in the thousands for them and you tell them that they're number two for you!

All told, we had a lot of fun and hopefully we attracted some new members in the incoming first-year class.
