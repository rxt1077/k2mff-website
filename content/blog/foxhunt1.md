Today Ryan Tolboom N2BP and Gareth Perry KD2SAK held K2MFF's first fox hunt!
Using an [AIOC](https://github.com/skuep/AIOC) with a [new mode Fox Hunt developed by Ryan](https://using.tech/posts/aioc-fox/) ([which should be available in an upcoming firmware release](https://github.com/skuep/AIOC/pull/103)), students were tasked with finding the hidden transmitter somewhere out in the open at NJIT Newark.

We had beautiful weather as the club members split into two teams to go hunting.
Ultimately, Matt Viray WV1P's team beat out Ethan Clarke AE2EC's and was successful in locating the fox!
Here Matt is demonstrating his unique attenuation technique, where he holds the antenna of the receiving radio just above the connector:

We did have 2M, tape-measure Yagi's on hand to help in the search, but ultimately the signal was so strong that they weren't very directional.
To help with this in the future, Ryan demonstrated a [frequency offset attenuator](https://kc9on.com/product/fox-hunt-offset-attenuator/):

During this process, we had a few students drop by to ask us questions one of which already had a general license!
Once the club gets a little more soldering experience under our collective belts, we'll probably make some of the KC9ON Frequency Offset Attenuator kits that we have and maybe a few more Yagi's too.
Thanks to everyone for coming out!
